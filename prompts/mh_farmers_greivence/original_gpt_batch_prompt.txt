You are given an Excel file containing farmer grievance comments.

Your task is STRICTLY LIMITED to:
1) Data cleaning
2) Character encoding correction
3) COMPLETE literal translation into English
4) Keyword-based grievance bucketing (rule-based only)

You MUST NOT infer intent, sentiment, or meaning beyond:
- literal translation
- direct keyword matching

Follow the steps EXACTLY in the order below.

────────────────────────
STEP 1 — Identify Comment Column
────────────────────────
- Automatically detect the column that contains farmer grievance text.
- Typical names may include: comment, remarks, grievance, feedback (English or Marathi).
- If multiple candidate columns exist, choose the column with the maximum number of non-null text rows.

────────────────────────
STEP 2 — Remove Blank Entries
────────────────────────
- Delete rows where the grievance/comment cell is:
  - NULL
  - Empty string
  - Whitespace-only
- Do NOT modify any remaining rows.

────────────────────────
STEP 3 — Fix Encoding Errors (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────
- Detect mojibake caused by UTF-8 text being mis-decoded as Latin-1 or Windows-1252.
- Reverse the encoding by:
  - Treating the displayed string as Latin-1 bytes
  - Decoding those bytes back into UTF-8
- Apply this step to ALL rows.
- If a row is already readable, leave it unchanged.

────────────────────────
STEP 4 — Language Normalisation & Translation
────────────────────────
- After encoding correction, detect script:
  - Devanagari (U+0900–U+097F) → Marathi
  - Roman → English
- If Marathi is detected:
  - Translate the FULL text into English.
  - Translation must be:
    - Literal
    - Complete
    - Meaning-preserving
    - Grammatically readable
- This applies EVEN IF the text is long, compound, or multi-clause.

You ARE ALLOWED to:
- Reorder words strictly to preserve meaning
- Resolve grammar required for correct translation

You are NOT ALLOWED to:
- Summarise
- Shorten
- Infer intent
- Add explanations
- Change factual meaning

────────────────────────
STEP 5 — Raw English Translation Rules
────────────────────────
- Preserve exactly:
  - Numbers
  - Units (days, hectare, amount, etc.)
  - Scheme names
  - Object names (sprinkler, drip irrigation, Aadhaar, bank, survey number)
  - Login IDs, passwords, reference numbers
- Keep mixed English words as-is.

────────────────────────
STEP 6 — Keyword-Based Bucketing (RULE-BASED ONLY)
────────────────────────
After translation, assign EACH comment to ONE bucket based ONLY on
direct keyword or phrase matching from the translated English text.

DO NOT infer or guess.
DO NOT assign multiple buckets.
If multiple buckets match, choose the FIRST bucket in the order below.

Bucket 1 — System / Portal Issues
Match if comment contains ANY of:
Portal not working, Website not opening, App crash, Login issue, OTP not received,
Unable to submit application, Submit button not working, Page not loading,
Session expired, Technical error shown, Server error, Internal error,
Something went wrong, Form not saving, Data not saved, Application stuck,
Upload failed, Document not uploaded, Attachment error, PDF not accepted,
File size issue, File format issue, Eligible component not visible,
Subsidy option missing, Scheme option missing, Wrong scheme shown,
Aadhaar not seeded, Aadhaar mismatch, Aadhaar verification failed,
Bank account mismatch, IFSC error, Account number incorrect,
NPCI mapping failed, Duplicate application error,
Already applied message, Application rejected as duplicate,
Status not updated, Approved but not visible, Approval not reflecting,
Data validation error

Bucket 2 — Departmental Process Delays
Payment delayed, Subsidy not received, Amount not credited, Money not received,
Benefit pending, Fund pending, Treasury pending, Payment under process,
Verification pending, Field verification pending, Panchanama not done,
Inspection pending, Officer visit not done, File pending at Taluka,
File pending at District, Approval pending, Signature pending,
Officer not approving, Work pending for long time,
No action taken, Delay from department

Bucket 3 — System–Department Coordination Issues
Approved but benefit not received, System shows approved but no payment,
Status mismatch, Status different in portal and office,
Treasury payment not reflected, Backend not updated,
Data not synced, Integration issue,
7/12 corrected but not reflected,
KYC updated but not reflecting,
Bank details updated but old data showing,
Duplicate application marked wrongly,
Application stuck due to backend issue,
Data mismatch between systems

Bucket 4 — Information & Communication Gaps
How to apply, Application process not known,
Which documents required, Eligibility criteria not clear,
Am I eligible, Scheme details not known,
Status not known, No update received,
No SMS received, No message received,
No confirmation received, No rejection reason shown,
Where to contact, Helpline not responding, Guidance required

Bucket 5 — Governance / Policy-Level Issues
Officer misbehaviour, Corruption complaint, Bribe demanded,
Favoritism, Discrimination, Intentional delay,
Harassment by officer, Threatened by staff,
Policy issue, Eligibility rule unclear,
Land ownership dispute, Joint land issue,
Name mismatch in land record,
Wrong rejection, Appeal request,
Inquiry requested, Disciplinary action requested

If NONE of the keywords match, assign:
Bucket = "Unclassified (No Keyword Match)"

────────────────────────
STEP 7 — Output Structure
────────────────────────
Create a NEW Excel sheet named: English_Comments

The sheet must contain EXACTLY these columns:
1) comment_raw_original
2) comment_raw_fixed_encoding
3) comment_english_raw
4) grievance_bucket

No additional columns are permitted.

────────────────────────
STEP 8 — Data Integrity Rules
────────────────────────
- 100% of non-blank rows must have English translation.
- 100% of rows must have a bucket.
- No row may be dropped after STEP 2.

────────────────────────
STEP 9 — Final Output
────────────────────────
- Provide a downloadable Excel file.
- Do NOT include explanations, summaries, or analysis.

Violation of any step above is considered an incorrect output.
